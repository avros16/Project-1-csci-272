In this project, you will re-create the classic race of the tortoise and the hare. You will use random number generation to develop a simulation of the memorable event.



Our contenders begin the race at “square 1” of 70 squares. Each square represents a possible position along the race course. The finish line is at square 70. The first contender to reach or pass square 70 is rewarded with a pail of fresh carrots and lettuce. The course weaves its way up the side of a slippery mountain, so occasionally the contenders lose ground.

There is a clock that ticks once per second. With each tick of the clock, your program should use function moveTortoise and moveHare to adjust the position of the animals according to the rules in the following figure. These functions should use pointer-based pass-by-reference to modify the position of the tortoise and the hare.
